# CHAPTER_6
## Using Common Widgets

In Chapter 6, I explore essential Flutter widgets that form the foundation of app design and functionality. I learn to use Scaffold, AppBar, SafeArea, and Container for app structure and layout, while Text and RichText help display content with various styles. Using Column and Row, I design flexible layouts by arranging widgets vertically or horizontally.

To make the app interactive, I learn about different button types, including ElevatedButton, TextButton, and IconButton. These buttons allow users to interact with the app, whether by emphasizing primary actions with ElevatedButton, providing secondary options with TextButton, or combining functionality with visuals using IconButton. Enhancing the app's visual appeal, I also study how to incorporate images, icons, and BoxDecoration to style containers with gradients, shadows, and rounded corners, giving the app a polished and professional look.

Furthermore, I explore TextField widgets to manage user input effectively. These widgets are crucial for creating forms and other interactive features, enabling me to retrieve, validate, and manipulate data reliably. Lastly, I learn how to handle different screen orientations by using MediaQuery to adjust layouts dynamically for portrait and landscape modes, ensuring the app remains user-friendly across various devices.
